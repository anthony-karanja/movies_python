# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview

The Movie Recommendation System is a Python-based application designed to recommend movies to users based on their preferences and behaviors. The project involves data collection from sources like IMDb or TMDb, the implementation of recommendation algorithms, and the creation of a web interface to display the recommendations.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection:** Scrape movie data from IMDb. 
- **Recommendation Algorithms:** Implement collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
- **Web Interface:** Create a web interface to display movie recommendations to users.

## Key Learning Areas

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering
- Machine learning
- Web scraping

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anthony-karanja/movies_python/blob/main/readme.md?plain=1
   cd movies_recommender
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

### Collect Movie Data

The `data_collection.py` script is responsible for collecting movie data from IMDb or TMDb using web scraping or API calls.

- **IMDb Example:**
  ```python
  import requests
  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

  def fetch_imdb_data():
      url = 'https://www.imdb.com/chart/top'
      response = requests.get(url)
      soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
      # Parse and save data
  ```

- **Run Data Collection:**
  ```bash
  python src/data_collection.py
  ```

### Data Preprocessing

Preprocess the collected data to clean and transform it into a suitable format for analysis and model building.

## Recommendation Algorithms

### Collaborative Filtering

- **User-based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies based on similar users' preferences.
- **Item-based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies based on similar movies.

### Content-Based Filtering

- Extract features from movie metadata (e.g., genre, director, actors).
- Build user profiles based on their preferences.

### Run Recommendation Algorithms

The `recommendation.py` script implements the recommendation algorithms.

- **Run Recommendation:**
  ```bash
  python src/recommendation.py
  ```

## Web Interface

The `web_app.py` script creates a web interface to display movie recommendations to users.

### Run the Web Application

- **Start the Web App:**
  ```bash
  python src/web_app.py
  ```

## Testing

Unit tests are provided in the `tests` directory to ensure the functionality of the data collection and recommendation algorithms.

### Run Tests

- **Run All Tests:**
  ```bash
  pytest tests/
  ```

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate hybrid recommendation algorithms.
- Improve the web interface for better user experience.
- Add user authentication and personalized recommendation features.
