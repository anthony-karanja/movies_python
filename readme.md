Collect Movie Data

    The data_collection.py script is responsible for collecting movie data from IMDb or TMDb using web scraping or API calls.

Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the collected data to clean and transform it into a suitable format for analysis and model building.

Recommendation Algorithms

Collaborative Filtering

    User-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on similar users' preferences.
